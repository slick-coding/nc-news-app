# NC News Application

## Setting up .env files

To properly run this project, you need to create two .env files in the main folder. Create a file called: `.env.development` and paste this text into the first line and save it:

```
PGDATABASE=nc_news
```

Next, create a file called: `.env.test` and paste this text into the first line and save it:

```
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
```

Then you should be ready to continue!
